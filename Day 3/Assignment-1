Q. Explore and explain various methods of console function.

A:
      In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console.
      The console object provides us with several different methods, like :

      >log()        This method outputs a message to the console
      >error()      Outputs an error message to the console. Useful in testing of code.
      >warn()       Used to log warning message to the console.
      >clear()      Clears the console
      >time()       Starts a timer (can track how long an operation takes)
      >timeEnd()    Stops a timer that was previously started by console.time() 
      >table()      This method allows us to generate a table inside a console. 
      >count()      Logs the number of times that this particular call to count() has been called
      >group()      Creates a new inline group in the console. This indents following console messages by an additional level, until console.groupEnd() is called
      >groupEnd()   Exits the current inline group in the console
